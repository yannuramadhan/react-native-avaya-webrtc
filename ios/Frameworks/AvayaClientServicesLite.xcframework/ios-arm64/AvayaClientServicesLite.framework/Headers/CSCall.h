 * Call Precedence Level
 *
 * DoD(Department of defence) UC networks support Precedence-Based Assured Services (PBAS) for delivery of UC services.
 * Connections and resources that belong to a call from a user are marked with a precedence level
 * and domain identifier and can only be preempted by calls of higher precedence from users in the same service domain.
 * Precedence provides for preferred handling of PBAS service requests. PBAS involves assigning and validating priority
 * levels to calls, and prioritized treatment of service requests.
 *
 * There are five precedence levels; from lowest to highest
 * they are ROUTINE, PRIORITY, IMMEDIATE, FLASH, and FLASH OVERRIDE.
 *
 * Maximum precedence level of a user is set at the subscription time by the UC network administrator
 * based on the user’s validated need. When initiating a session, the user may select a precedence level
 * up to and including the maximum authorized precedence level for that user, on a per call basis.
 *
 * The network at the user's originating interface ensures that the selected precedence level
 * does not exceed the maximum level assigned to that extension.
 *
 * When JITC Multilevel call precedence and preemption (MLPP) is enabled at server, A call will
 * default automatically to the ROUTINE precedence unless a higher precedence is dialed.

/**
 * Call Preemption reasons based on Reason Header for Preemption Events (RFC 4411) - IETF
 * and Department of Defense Unified Capabilities Requirements 2013.
 *
 * Call preemption occurs when a precedence call is sent to a preemptable endpoint
 * that is busy with a call of lower precedence and has no idle appearances.
 * This causes the lower precedence call to be preempted, regardless of whether
 * the lower precedence call and the new higher precedence call are of the same media type.
 * When preemption occurs, the active busy user receive a continuous preemption tone until user
 * acknowledges the preemption by invoking complete preemption method and the other party receives
 * a preemption tone for a minimum of 3 seconds.
 * After acknowledging the preemption, the extension to which the precedence call is directed will
 * be provided with precedence ringing and the calling party will receive an audible ring-back
 * precedence tone.
 *
 * Preemption may take one of two forms.
 * First, the called party may be busy with a lower precedence call that is preempted
 * in favor of completing the higher precedence call from the calling party.
 * Second, the network resources may be busy with calls; some of which are of lower
 * precedence than the call requested by the calling party. One or more of these lower
 * precedence calls are preempted in order to complete the higher precedence call.

 * that is busy with a call of lower precedence and has no idle appearances.
 * This causes the lower precedence call to be preempted, regardless of whether
 * the lower precedence call and the new higher precedence call are of the same media type.

 * acknowledges the preemption by invoking complete preemption method and the other party receives
 * a preemption tone for a minimum of 3 seconds.
 * After acknowledging the preemption, the extension to which the precedence call is directed will
 * be provided with precedence ringing and the calling party will receive an audible ringback
 * precedence tone.
 *

 * preemption tone before calling ::CSCallFeatureService::completePreemptionForCall:completionHandler:
 * when user acknowledges the preemption.
 * However when other end receives preemption application must stop tone after 3 seconds and
