 * Prepares the client for a period of background operation during which the process may be

 * This is used to support the background mode for VoIP applications on iOS. In this mode a keepalive handler
 * is used to wake up the application periodically while it is in the background, and between invocations of
 * this handler the process may be suspended. During the interval in which the process is suspended the
 * client may need to refresh its registration with the call server in order to maintain service. This method
 * checks for any such conditions and, if possible, performs them immediately so that the client will
 * maintain service while the process is in the suspended state.
 *
 * In some cases it may not be possible for the client to support the specified background interval. For
 * example, if the requested background interval is 10 minutes and the user's call server has been configured
 * with a registration refresh time of 5 minutes, this method will return NO as it is not possible to support
 * a 10 minute suspend interval when the registration must be refreshed every 5 minutes. If this method
 * returns NO the application should use the best available means of preventing the application from being
 * suspended, or inform the user that background operation is not possible. Because the conditions that
 * prevent use of the specified background interval may change during the life of the application it should
 * support the return value of this method changing each time the application enters the background or its
 * keepalive handler is invoked.
 *
 * @param interval The maximum time interval that the application may be suspended for. This should be the
 *        same value passed to -[UIApplication setKeepAliveTimeout:handler:].

 * @return YES if the client was able to successfully prepare for the specified background interval, NO if

 * Called by the client application for the ClientSDK to process the push
 * notification message received from the Apple Push Notification service
 * (APNs).
 * A dictionary of name/value pairs representing different attributes of the
 * push notification message is returned. The returned information may include
 * the folloowing attributes:
 * * "callReferenceId": Unique id assigned by Client SDK to represent
 * a Call object that is created as a result of processing a VoIP
 * push notification message. It is recommended that this id be used in
 * reportNewIncomingCallWithUUID CallKit API call so that a CSCall object
 * subsequently created by Client SDK can be correlated to an existing
 * CallKit alerting call.
 * * "callType" : Type of the call:
 *    * "REGULAR": for a regular incoming call, or
 *    * "BRIDGED": for incoming call on a bridged call appearance.
 * * "callingNumber": Telephone number of the calling party.
 * * "callingName": Network provided calling party display name.
 * * "alertType" : Alert style for the call:
 *    * "INTERNAL": Caller is an Avaya Aura Communication Manager extension number.
 *    * "EXTERNAL": Caller is an external telephone number, not an Avaya
 *     Aura Communication Manager extension number.
 *    * "PRIORITY": Caller requested priority calling through Avaya Aura Communication Manager.
 *    * "NO_RING": No audible alerting needed for the call. Note that this may not be possible
 *     to support through CallKit APIs unless a custom audio file containing silence is played.
 *    * "INTERCOM": Incoming call is an intercom call.
 *    * "AUTO_CALLBACK": Incoming call is a result of the Communication Manager completing
 *     an automatic callback request that was previously requested by the local iOS user.
 * * "lineAppearanceId": Avaya Aura Communication Manager's call appearance id
 *  that the incoming call is assigned to.
 * * "lineAppearanceOwner": (Bridged call appearance calls only)
 *  Owner extension number the incoming call is associated with when the iOS client
 *  has a bridged call appearance to the owner extension number's call appearance.
 *  This can be used as part of the incoming call text displayed at the CallKit UI.
 * * "calledName" : (Bridged call appearance calls only)
 *  Name associated with the primary extension number that received the call.
 * * "calledNumber": (Bridged call appearance calls only)
 *  Primary extension number that received the call. It is usually the same number as the one
 *  reported in "lineAppearanceOwner".
 * * "existingCall" : Indicates whether the call was already reported to the application. This can happen
 *  if the iOS application is not suspended, and receives an incoming call before the
 *  push notification message is received.
 * * "isConference": Indicates whether the incoming call was dialed out by an
 *  Avaya conferencing system. Not used in the CallKit API call.
 * * "isVideoEnabled":  Indicates whether the incoming call has video requested.
 *  Not used in the CallKit API call.
 * * "isAutoAnswer": (Future) Indicates whether the incoming call needs to be auto answered.
 *  This is only applicable to  Avaya Aura CC Elite contact center environment.
 *
 * A sample dictionary is as follows:
 *
 * [ alertType, INTERNAL]
 * [ callReferenceId, F79E9675-83E6-422B-8443-A75EB120E79A]
