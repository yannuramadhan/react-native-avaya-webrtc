 * The CSMessagingService object provides a set of APIs that allow

 *
 * In general, the capabilities and the set of allowed operations

 * The client application is notified about status updates reported by the messaging server
 * through delegate that the application has added to the
 * CSMessagingService object. These updates may be the result of local operations
 * on the MessagingService object as well as remote changes initiated by either the server
 * or other participants of any conversation.
