/**
 * This class defines an interface that client applications use to perform data retrieval operations
 * for both static and dynamic collections of objects within the SDK.
 *
 * An instance of this watcher class is created by the client application for use in methods that
 * initiate some form of data retrieval operation that runs asynchronously and updates a collection
 * of objects.  It can be used in cases where a static collection of objects is being
 * retrieved (e.g. search results, etc) or for dynamically updated collections that are retrieved
 * and then subsequently updated as events occur within the system (e.g. the active participants
 * in a conference call).
 *
 * Following creation of a CSDataRetrievalWatcher object, and before the object is used in a
 * method call, the application should install a CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate on the object.
 * This allows the application's delegate to be wired up prior to initiating the action that will perform the
 * data retrieval.
 *
 * For **static** collections, the
 * {@link CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate::dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems: dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems}
 * message will be sent as objects are added to the collection during the retrieval.
 * Once the static collection has been completely retrieved, the
 * {@link CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate::dataRetrievalWatcherDidComplete: dataRetrievalWatcherDidComplete}
 * message will be sent indicating that the retrieval is complete.  Following this, no additional messages will be sent.
 *
 * For **dynamic** collections, the
 * {@link CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate::dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems: dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems}
 * message will be sent as objects are added to the collection during the initial retrieval.
 * It will also be sent whenever any of the objects already in the collection are changed or removed.
 * Once the initial retrieval of the dynamic collection has been completed, the
 * {@link CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate::dataRetrievalWatcherDidComplete: dataRetrievalWatcherDidComplete}
 * message will be sent indicating that the initial retrieval is complete.
 * Following this, the
 * {@link CSDataRetrievalWatcherDelegate::dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems: dataRetrievalWatcher:contentsDidChange:changedItems}
 * message will be sent whenever any changes to the collection occur.
