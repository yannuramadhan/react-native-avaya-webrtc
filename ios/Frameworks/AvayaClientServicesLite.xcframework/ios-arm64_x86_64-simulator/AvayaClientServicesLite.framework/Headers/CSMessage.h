/**
 * Interface for all Message related tasks and properties.
 *
 * Message is a crucial part of the conversation. It can store not only text content or attachments,
 * but is also used to inform about any event that occurred in the conversation, like a new participant or
 * subject change. It is important to notice that the body cannot be empty for a usual message,
 * unless an attachment is present.
 *
 * To create a new message, call the {@link CSMessagingConversation::createMessage -[CSMessagingConversation createMessage]} method,
 * which will return a new object. After filling out the message and its other parameters,
 * use the {@link sendWithCompletionHandler:} operation in order to send a message.
 *
 * An important part of the message is also attachments. In order to create a new attachment
 * in a message object, use the {@link createAttachment} method.
 *
 * Besides normal messages with text body there are also messages informing about events.
 * {@link CSMessagingType} is informing about an event type and these objects do not contain any text body.
 * They can have some additional data about an event, i.e. {@link addedParticipants}, {@link removedParticipants}, etc.
