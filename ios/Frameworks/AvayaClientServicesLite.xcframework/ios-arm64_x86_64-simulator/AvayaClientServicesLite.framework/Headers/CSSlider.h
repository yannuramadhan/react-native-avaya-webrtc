 * @brief The CSSlider object provides access to slider-related actions.
 * This object is accessible via the CSCollaboration object.
 *
 * Feature overview:
 *
 * - The server periodically generates a 'screenshot' of currently presented
 *   content (screen sharing or whiteboard) and notifies clients that the data
 *   is available to download. The client is notified of these new "slides" 
 *   via the ::CSSliderDelegate::slider:didAddSlides:.
 *
 * - For each slide, the client can download the full image and/or the smaller thumbnail.
 *
 * Certain collaboration/server events (i.e. change of presenter) might make the slides 
 * unavailable which is reported via the ::CSSliderDelegate::slider:didRemoveSlides: delegate method.

/**
 * NSArray of currently available slides.
 *
 * This property is useful if client does not want to handle ::CSSliderDelegate
 * events when the slider feature is not displayed to the user. It can be used 
 * to obtain the up-to-date collection of slides when the slider UI is about to
 * be displayed. To receive further slide updates, the client should set
 * ::CSSlider::delegate.
 * The client should obtain current collection and set ::CSSlider::delegate in
 * a single method, invoked on the same dispatch queue as passed to the 
 * ::CSClient. This guarantees that no slides are duplicated or missed due to 
 * race conditions.
