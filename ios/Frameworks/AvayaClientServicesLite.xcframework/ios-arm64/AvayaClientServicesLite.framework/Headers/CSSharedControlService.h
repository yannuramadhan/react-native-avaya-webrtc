/**
 * This service provides the user with the ability to direct media to the Desk Phone (Hard Phone)
 * while issuing signaling commands from the Desk Phone and/or the client.
 * Access to the shared control service is provided by the SharedControlService property on the {@link CSUser} class.
 * A Spark based shared signalling channel is established between the controlling client (soft client)
 * and the controlled device (Desk Phone) through the Aura Session Manager, to keep call states in sync
 * and communicate signaling messages.
 * The Shared Control mechanism is a first party control mechanism similar to the CTI interface traditionally 
 * provided on Windows PCs except that the controlling and controlled endpoints are endpoints registered with
 * Avaya Aura.
 * This feature has two main entities:
 * @li @c @b Controlled Endpoint/Client/Device - Avaya endpoints that support the shared control mechanism advertise their support by inserting "avaya-sc-enabled"
 * tag in the contact URI they register. The clients are currently not planned to be controlled endpoints.
 * @li @c @b Controlling Endpoint/Client - when a user chooses to run the client in the shared control mode, the application does not receive incoming calls
 * from the server but from the controlled endpoint instead. This is done so that all incoming and outgoing requests
 * are sent over to the endpoint that is “actively” registered with Aura (the desk phone) and receives incoming calls.
 * The client always acts as a controlling endpoint.
 *
 * @attention Following are the current limitations in Shared Control:
 * @li @c Currently only SIP mode is supported for Shared Control.
 * @li @c Currently SM is the only Avaya registrar that supports the registration in Shared Control.
 * @li @c Currently only Avaya 96x1 desk phones and Summit (H175) series are supported for Shared Control.
 * @li @c The server addresses list on the controlling and controlled endpoints should be identical to avoid registration issues.
 * @li @c Split media i.e.audio on controlled endpoint and video on controlling endpoint is only supported with Summit (H175) phones.
 * @li @c The controlled endpoint supports only one controlling endpoint in Shared Control. The latest controlling endpoint
 *   initiating the session controls the controlled endpoint. For instance: if UC client - 1 is in Shared Control with
 *   controlled endpoint, and UC client - 2 initiates Shared Control with same controlled endpoint,
 *   the session with client - 1 is ended by controlled endpoint.
