/**
 * CSScreenSharingListener is a class that is responsible for two things:
 * 1. It's a listener to a CSContentSharingDelegate which delegates events
 * coming from collaboration server concerning content sharing.
 * 2. It's a drawing delegate of CALayer behind a CSScreenSharingView object
 * and it's responsible for drawing incoming frames on the layer.
 *
 * \if OSX
 *
 * Proper use of this class:
 * - Client creates a view of CSScreenSharingView class
 * - Client creates a CSScreenSharingListener object (inited with sharing view's size)
 * - set contentSharingDelegate of CSScreenSharingView to object of CSScreenSharingListener class
 *
 * \endif
 *
 * \if iOS
 *
 * Proper use of this class:
 * - Client creates a view of CSIOSScreenSharingView class
 * - Client creates a CSScreenSharingListener object (inited with sharing view's size)
 * - set contentSharingDelegate of CSIOSScreenSharingView to object of CSScreenSharingListener class
 *
 * \endif
 *
 * Client doesn't need to invoke methods of this class in order to make content sharing work
 * unless custom screen sharing view is developed.
 *
 * @see CSContentSharingDelegate
