/**
 * This service provides the user with the ability to direct media to any other phone
 * (typically a cell phone/ home phone) while controlling signaling from the client.
 * Access to the this service is provided by the otherPhoneNumber property on the {@link CSUser} class.
 * When other phone mode is activated, at any given point of time, only one number will
 * be used as the other phone number.
 * For any outgoing or incoming call, there would be one call towards the other phone number
 * and one call towards the target number.
 * Applications would still have a single call, towards the target number to manage.
 * The second call leg towards other phone will be managed internally by Client SDK.
 *
 * @attention following are limitations in other phone mode:
 * @li @c currently video calls are not supported in other phone mode
 * @li @c HTTP calls are not supported in other phone mode
 *
 *
 * <p>The CSOtherPhoneService object provides a set of APIs that allows application developers to
 * activate and deactivate the other phone number.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The client application is notified about status updates reported by the other phone services
 * through a delegate that the application adds to the CSOtherPhoneService object.
 * These updates may be the result of local operations on the CSOtherPhoneService object.</p>
