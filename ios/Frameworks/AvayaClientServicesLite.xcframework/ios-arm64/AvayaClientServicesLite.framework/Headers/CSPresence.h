/**
 * Presence information for a user.
 *
 * <p>This class is used to create and set up a desired presence state for a local user (outgoing presence)
 * or get presence states for other users (incoming presence).
 * Presence information is divided into 2 parts: an automatic part and an application part.</p>
 *
 * <p>The automatic part consists of so-called presence channels and their availability.
 * A channel is a way to communicate to a user including communication address and availability of the channel.
 * The channels include a phone channel, a video channel, an IM channel and a calendar channel.
 * For instance, phone channel represents a phone number of a user and current {@link CSPresenceState} of the channel. 
 * If the state of the phone channel is available, the user is able to receive calls. If the state is "on a call", the user is unlikely to accept a new call.
 * The automatic part of presence information is controlled by the library and used for incoming presence only.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The application part of presence information consists of manually published {@link CSPresenceState}, {@link CSPresenceLocationMode} and a note.
 * These are used for both incoming and outgoing presence, and controlled by the application.
 * Application {@link CSPresenceState} is a presence state that a user wants to set their client to.
 * Application {@link CSPresenceLocationMode} is also controlled by the user specifying their current location.
 * Application note is just a short string representing some user comment regarding their current status.</p>
 *
 * <p>Although there are many aspects to presence information, there is also an overall presence state populated automatically.
 * The overall state should be used to represent the state of the user.</p>
 *
 * @see {@link CSPresenceService}

 * with the optional elements. For example, if the {@link CSPresenceOptions::CSPresenceOptionNote}
 * option is set and the note string is empty, any existing note on the
 * server will be removed. If the option is not set the note will not be
