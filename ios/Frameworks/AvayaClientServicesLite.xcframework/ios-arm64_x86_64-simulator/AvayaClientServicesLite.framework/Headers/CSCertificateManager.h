/**
 * Certificate manager class allows application developers to configure and make
 * use of the library's client/server certificate trust validation logic.
 * It allows specification of a client identity certificate, configure a
 * private trust store and certificate trust validation of all the connections,
 * application is making on its own.
 *
 *
 * The developers can use the {@link #setCertificates:error:} method
 * to create a private trust store. It (private trust store) is an application
 * managed certificate store that contains the Root and Intermediate CA certificates
 * trusted (known as "trusted anchors") by an application. The private trust store is
 * used to validate the server/client certificate chain for all the secure connections
 * made by an application.
 *
 *
 * The private trust store has following advantages over the conventional system
 * certificate stores provided by Operating System -
 *
 * <ul>
 *      <li>The private trust store offers a <i>sandbox</i> certificate store
 *      exclusively used and managed by an application.</li>
 *
 *      <li>The trusted anchors (certificates) in the private trust store are
 *      not shared with trusted anchors from system certificate store.</li>
 *
 *      <li>Application administrators choose to distribute only necessary trusted
 *      CA certificates in a controlled way, not worrying for any rouge CA
 *      certificate being added to the private trust store.
 *      </li>
 *
 *      <li>Application can <i>create</i> and <i>delete</i> the private trust store without
 *      affecting the system certificate stores and thus affecting other connection-oriented
 *      applications.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The private trust store allows application to be more secure. For example, consider a scenario
 * where a CA inadvertently had issued certificates and revoked those later on. CA publishes the
 * certificate status information so that application may choose to query and proceed. However,
 * revocation status check process has its own challenges making it unsuitable, causing the
 * rouge servers to be trusted by an applications. Such cases can be easily managed by using
 * the private trust store. Application administrator may simply remove the corresponding CA
 * certificate that had issued invalid certificates such that insecure connections cannot
 * be established with the server.
 *
 * This class allows an application to store a client identity certificate which can be used to
 * pass on to the server upon server's request during TLS Mutual Authentication. A client identity
 * certificate is trust validated by the server and untrusted certificate will be rejected by the
 * server by issuing SSL Alert and severing the connection.
 *
 * The client applications can register a certificate status listener to get notified when client
 * identity certificate is about to expire. This notification serves as a reminder for an user
 * to begin requesting a renewed certificate for this application. This notification period
 * can be configured using {@link CSSecurityPolicyConfiguration}.
 *
 * Applications that have been using default certificate trust validation logic, can now delegate
 * the trust validation request to this class. The certificate validation methods offered by this class
 * allows the use of the private trust store or system trust store. Also, certain behavior
 * of these methods can be preconfigured based on the application deployment scenarios via
 * {@link CSSecurityPolicyConfiguration}.

 * or shares them while looking for the trusted anchors.
 *
 * As part of the trust validation, this method performs an extended hostname validation (known as "server identity validation")
 * by matching different identifiers as explained below. The configured hostname is internally supplied by each "Service" or
 * "Provider" calling this method. The client application can configure a policy to ignore the hostname validation errors. Such
 * policy can be set via {@link CSSecurityPolicyConfiguration::continueOnTLSServerIdentityFailure} property. By default, this method
 * currently ignores all hostname validation errors.
 *
 * The hostname is matched as per the following order of identifiers:
 *
 * -# The match is performed against identifiers like DNS name and IP address from certificate's subject alternative name (SAN)
 * attribute.
 * -# If subject alternative name attribute is unavailable, the match is performed against certificate's common name (CN) attribute.
 *
 * For SIP service domains, a full match is performed against URI and DNS parameters value from certificate's subject alternative name
 * attribute.
 *
 * For Wildcard certificates, a partial matching for DNS hostname is supported except for SIP service domains (RFC 5922).
 *
 * Following rules apply for partial matching:
 *
 * @li The match is performed at a single level sub-domain.
 *     @c *.example.com matches with @c foo.example.com
 *     @c *.*.example.com does not match with @c foo.bar.example.com
 * @li Internet TLDs (Top Level Domains) do not match.
 *     @c *.com does not match with @c example.com
 *     @c *.co.in does not match with @c example.co.in
 * @li Partial domain name match is not supported.
 *     @c f*.example.com does not match with @c foo.example.com
 * @li Partial matching for SIP service domain is not supported.
 *
 *
 * This method verifies certificate's revocation status, however, this feature is not supported on iOS. The revocation status
 * of an entire certificate chain is verified using OCSP or CRL. The revocation check using OCSP is preferred over CRL.
 * The client application can configure the security policy to be used while processing the revocation errors. The security
 * policy can be configured by setting {@link CSSecurityPolicyConfiguration::revocationCheckPolicy}.
 *
 *
 * @param secTrustRef           A reference to the trust object to evaluate.
