 * **Unsupported:**
 * The pending participant feature is currently not supported.
 * The CSPendingParticipant class represents a participant pending to join the conference.
 *
 * When a conference call is locked, a person who wishes to join the call may "knock on the
 * conference room door" using conference server's knock on the door feature. This person is
 * described as a pending participant, because the person is waiting to join the call.
 * The conference moderator(s) may choose to grant or reject the pending participant's request.
 * Access grant and rejection are controlled by acceptWithCompletionHandler() and
 * and denyWithCompletionHandler() methods defined on CSPendingParticipant, respectively.
 * It should be noted that not all conference server releases support this feature.
 * The client application should check CSConference object's acceptDenyPendingParticipantCapability,
 * to find out whether the conference server supports this feature, and the local user
 * has permission to accept/reject entry to pending participants.
