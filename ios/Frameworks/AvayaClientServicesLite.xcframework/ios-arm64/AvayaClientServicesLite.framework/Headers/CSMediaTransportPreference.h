 * The list of Media Transport network preferences.

 * network connectivity. It is necessary to allow a feature to be enabled based
 * on the preference of network connectivity.
 * All Transports (enabled) and No Media (disabled are independent of network
 * type. The WiFI only state is included to indicate that the feature is
 * dependent on WiFi connectivity.
